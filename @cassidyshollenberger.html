<p>
  I was born in Rockville, MD. I am one of three kids in a family of five.
  I have two younger brothers, Steven (18) and John (16).
</p><p>
  I have a dog named Zoey and she is 8 years old. She definitely gets the most attention from everyone in my family!
</p><p>
  My dad is a CPA and owns his own company and my mom is an athletic personal trainer. They both have worked very hard to get where they are today and support our family
</p><p>
  My family and I are Redskins fans and we are big into sports.
  My brothers and I all play lacrosse.
  I graduated from Damascus High School in 2013
