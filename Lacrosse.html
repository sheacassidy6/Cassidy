<p>
  I started playing lacrosse when I was in the fifth grade, when my dad decided to coach my rec team.
  I played soccer in the years up to that and after one season of playing lacrosse, I knew that was the sport I wanted to stick with.
  Once I was in the eighth grade, I realized I wanted to take my game to the next level and I started playing club lacrosse.
  I played competitively for four years after that, up until my senior year of highschool.
  As a freshman in highschool, I made varsity and from there started every game of my highschool career.
  The summer going into my senior year of highschool was when I began my search for division 1 colleges to play at.
  In June of 2012 I verbally committed to play here at GW, and signed my letter of intent that following November.
  Now, I am going into my third season at GW as a starting attacker.
