		  <h2>Background</h2>
		  <p>I was born in Rockville, MD. I am one of three kids in a family of five. I have two younger brothers, Steven (18) and John (16). I have a dog named Zoey and she is 8 years old. She definitely gets the most attention from everyone in my family! My dad is a CPA and owns his own company and my mom is an athletic personal trainer. They both have worked very hard to get where they are today and support our family. My family and I are Redskins fans and we are big into sports. My brothers and I all play lacrosse. I graduated from Damascus High School in 2013. My mom and I are very close and we both love cooking. She is of Italian decent so she loves teaching me how to cook and passes on recipes. Sunday's are always big at our house because that's Sunday Night Football. My mom and I always cook a big meal so as a family we can all watch football and enjoy some good food!</p>
